4. Once the installation is completed, do a complete restart of your computer and try opening Virutal Box, just to ensure that everything was installed properly. 

5. Now we are going to create some changes in the BIOS. Different vendors may have different methods of accessing the BIOS, please refer to (this)[https://www.lifewire.com/bios-setup-utility-access-keys-for-popular-computer-systems-2624463] article for more details about your specific vendor.
