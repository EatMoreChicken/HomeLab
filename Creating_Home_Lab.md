## Install Virtualizing Software

1. For this walkthrough, we will be using Orcale's VM Virtual Box, it is one of the best free virtualizing programs availble.
    - You can download it here: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
    
2. Once on Oracle's download page, choose the appropriate installation link for your operating system, I will be choosing `Windows Host`.

4. Once the installation is completed, do a complete restart of your computer and try opening Virutal Box, just to ensure that everything was installed properly. You may encounter an error regarding virtualization, so we will fix that now.

5. We are going to create some changes in the BIOS. Different vendors may have different methods of accessing the BIOS, please refer to [this](https://www.lifewire.com/bios-setup-utility-access-keys-for-popular-computer-systems-2624463) article for more details about your specific vendor.

6. From the BIOS, you will need to enable "Virtualizing Technology". Please refer to the following article for futher help enabling virutalization on your machine: [Enabling Virtualization](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Virtualization_Guide/sect-Virtualization-Troubleshooting-Enabling_Intel_VT_and_AMD_V_virtualization_hardware_extensions_in_BIOS.html)

7. Once virtualization has been enabled, restart your machine and start Virtual Box to ensure you do not have any other errors. Now you are ready to install a Virtual Machine!
